			<div class="h"><span class="h1">What I will accomplish in IST <img class="cat" height=60 width=auto src="https://remixie.com/v/images/panther.png"></span></div>
			<p>I chose ist for multiple reasons, one of the reasons for me choosing ist is because I wanted to do graphic designing. Graphic designing has been a dream of mine ever since I learned about video games.(I honestly dont remember when that was but basically at age 5 I think) Graphic desgining just seems so fun and watching my design on a video game or an animation is,to me the best part of designing any character.</p>
			<p>I will accomplish becoming a graphic designer by working hard and doing the best I can. Mostly I would like to learn more than just graphic designing,maybe some more html and css, so it could help me out in the long run. I also would like to make a lot of money so I wont have any money problems and so I can keep my life not as hard as it already is.This is how and why I would want to become a graphic designer and why I chose IST.</p>
